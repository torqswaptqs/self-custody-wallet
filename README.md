## Overview

Torq Wallet is a non-custodial crypto wallet built for traders who demand both ironclad security and execution speed. Your keys never leave your device, and your trades never wait in line. Designed from the ground up for active on-chain traders, Torq combines hardware-grade key management with a high-performance trading engine optimized for sub-second order routing.

**You own your keys. You own your trades. No middlemen, no custodians, no compromises.**

## Quick Start

1. **Install** Torq on your platform of choice.
2. **Create a wallet** or import an existing one using a seed phrase or hardware device.
3. **Back up your seed phrase** — write it down and store it offline. Torq cannot recover it for you.
4. **Fund your wallet** by sending crypto to your address or bridging from another chain.
5. **Start trading** — connect to any dApp or use the built-in swap interface.

## Architecture

Torq is built on a modular, security-focused architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              User Interface (React)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Trading Engine (Rust core)            │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┤
│   Key Vault (WASM)   │   Routing & Quote API    │
├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┤
│         Chain Adapters (EVM, SVM, BTC)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **UI layer** — React + TypeScript for desktop, mobile, and extension clients
- **Core engine** — A Rust trading engine compiled to native binaries and WebAssembly
- **Key vault** — Isolated cryptographic module with zero Torqwork access
- **Chain adapters** — Pluggable modules for each supported blockchain

---

## Security

Security is the foundation of Torq, not an afterthought.

- **Audits** — Audited by leading security firms; full reports available in [`/audits`](./audits)
- **Bug bounty** — Up to $250,000 for critical vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)
- **Reproducible builds** — Verify that the binary you run matches the public source code
- **No telemetry by default** — Opt-in only, never tied to wallet addresses

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email **security@Torq.io** rather than opening a public issue.
